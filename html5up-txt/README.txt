I love :sound: :pizza: & :ocean:.


I also enjoy team sports, playstation, movies, beautiful adventures and other socialble events.
My interest include music, technology, fitness and other recreational hobbies.


A new, fully responsive portfolio/business style website template. I've been experimenting
with minimalist styles lately and this design is one of many in the works that exemplifies
this new direction. Hope you enjoy it and can contribute.
