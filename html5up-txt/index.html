																Myer Briggs Result: Extroverted perosnality, thinker and judger with these taken into consideration the best position for me as recommned was a leader. This would help me in a team enviroment and influence my decision making in the team.
																Online Learning Styles Result: Auditory Learning so learning via sound is the best way for me to learn a certain system.
																Creativity Test Result: 58.5 shows that I am above average in this test but definatley not the highest in certain area of this broad test.
																
																Project Idea: Online Game using Unity Software.
															        Overview: I am aiming to create a open world RPG game that is quite similar to the free world scale and design of Grand Theft Auto but also with the military and first person shooter of Call of Duty to do this I am aiming to create a open urban world similar to the Grand Theft Auto design of Rockstar but bring the call of duty experience across to it creating a open world Guerilla Warfare type experience to all players. 
																	Multiple online servers in all corners of the world and fully customizable game play including interchangeable weapons outfits, clothing, accessories, household items and even pets you can buy and equip as part of your militia either as attack animals or household pets.  
															        Motivation: Motivation to create such a game comes from the enjoyment of both Grand Theft Auto and Call of Duty alike having played and enjoyed both what is better than a combination of the two if they coincide with each other then why not create a urban warfare environment that both open world and first person  shooters can enjoy together in either timed sessions or open city warfare totally at the players choice? 
                                                                                                                                        The statistics for a game like this are very high with a lot of people being interested in both open world and first person shooter games which will increase the profitability endlessly. 
                                                                                                                                Description: 
																	Expanding on what Iâ€™ve said in the opening overview and motivation the description of this game I am aiming to design using online and offline gaming software is a open world guerilla warfare environment similar to the likes of GTA or even FarCry although with the Rockstar open world design and bring across the Call of Duty first person shooter type scenario without the timed and teamed environment on a necessary basis. 
                                                                                                                                        So the option will be their for timed and teamed gameplay although you can explore the open world as you wish without the timed and teamed option leading to a large scale futuristic urban warfare the story will be based along quite a similar idea within a private military contractor who is operating either on his own or within a small team against other military contractors over resources and other miscellaneous items after a large scale bio-chemical attack that wipes out 80% of the population via human toxic gas that leaves no trace within minutes of contact and keeps all resources and valuables intact leaving large cities full of decomposing corpses in the lower class areas but clean of these areas is happening during warfare but military contractors moving and local governments cleaning up. 
                                                                                                                                        This is after the theoretical super nations attack each other and you get to pick a side and city from your said nation to defend as both nations have wiped out each otherâ€™s main population once you have picked your side you can build your own resources, recruit people, work for larger groups or for your own said remaining government. The story line goes for approximately 150 hours with continuous resource making missions and intelligence gaining operations popping up once completed the 150 hours to keep you satisfied and gaming for longer periods of time and if connected to the a online server the pop up missions can constantly change and be updated every so often in correlation with online events even just when playing in offline mode but constantly updated. 
                                                                                                                                        There will be open message boards, instant chats and online stores as with any other first person shooter or open world game this keeps the door open for weapon upgrades, special event purchases and for people that want to extend their rein over the online gaming community the ability to purchase copious amounts of needed resources and other items. 
                                                                                                                                        Online warfare will be setup monthly with special events costing players money to play as well as special free events for anyone with an online connection with small maps and layout that can be customized by the players or teams themselves to choose the terrain, environment, obstacles and buildings they battle within although these online events are also resource and intelligence gathering occasions. 
                                                                                                                                        Clans, Gangs, Military Groups or Government organizations can be joined, created or established depending on resources collected, intelligence gathered or players availability to join and the choice is yours so these items can either be gathered by continuous gameplay or purchase by the alpha gamer who enjoys buying these things online to either create an online government organization or military group similar to offline mode although the purchased items are never identical to the resources and intelligence you can gather without purchasing giving the opportunity for continuous players to outweigh purchasing players on a few different levels. 
                                                                                                                                Tools & Technologies:
																	Unity will be the main design platform accompanied by recommendations from other gaming developers, with a dedicated team using the latest hardware to create a game with exceptional quality.
                                                                                                                                        Using a similar design to others is going to require some legal tools also although using your own platform and idea that nothing will be quite the same at all but playability being quite similar although most playable platforms are universal, they cannot be exactly the same.
                                                                                                                                        Once software, hardware, developers & legal teams come together you use these tools to create a one of a kind playable experience for the casual or fulltime gamer.
                                                                                                                                Skills Required: A bachelor degree in programming, developing or ICT would be suitable for most to accomplish this in a team environment with other members of the team having the adjacent degree or master in specific field required to complete the goal although a bachelor degree is not essential depending on the skill level of the developer may be self learnt or lower level education such a diploma can still definitely be a part of a team that develops such a game having endless amounts of work to do for all specific skill sets in either the hardware or software section of development.                                    									        
																	Outcome: The development of this game would bring income to the developing team which in turn creates the revenue to be able to continue game development in the same or similar areas but also creating a game experience that all people can enjoy either being deeply immersed in the game or having a casual play to fill in some time but also everybody in-between. Giving users the online and offline experience at all levels bringing them into a fully customizable ever-expanding game experience. 
                                                                                                                                        That also bridges the gap between first person and open world gaming experience for all users that choose to play this game.
